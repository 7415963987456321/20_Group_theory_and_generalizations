\subsection{Definition}

{\bf Definition -} Let $G$ be a group. Two subgroups $S_1, S_2 \subseteq G$ are said to be {\bf commensurable}, in which case we write $S_1 \sim S_2$, if $S_1 \cap S_2$ has finite index both in $S_1$ and in $S_2$, i.e. if $[S_1 : S_1 \cap S_2]$ and $[S_2 : S_1 \cap S_2]$ are both finite.


This \PMlinkescapetext{property} can be interpreted informally in the following \PMlinkescapetext{way}: $S_1$ and $S_2$ are commensurable if their intersection $S_1 \cap S_2$ is ``big'' in both $S_1$ and $S_2$.

\subsection{Commensurability is an equivalence relation}

{\bf \PMlinkescapetext{Proposition} -} \PMlinkescapetext{Commensurability} of subgroups is an equivalence relation. In particular, if $S_1 \sim S_2$ and $S_2 \sim S_3$, then $S_1 \sim S_3$.

{\bf \emph{\PMlinkescapetext{Proof}:}} Let $S_1$, $S_2$ and $S_3$ be subgroups of a group $G$.
\begin{itemize}
\item Reflexivity: we have that $S_1 \sim S_1$, since $[S_1: S_1] = 1$.
\item Symmetry: is clear from the definition.
\item Transitivity: if $S_1 \sim S_2$ and $S_2 \sim S_3$, then one has
\begin{eqnarray*}
[S_1:S_1 \cap S_3] & \leq & [S_1:S_1 \cap S_2 \cap S_3]\\
& = & [S_1:S_1 \cap S_2][S_1 \cap S_2 : S_1 \cap S_2 \cap S_3]\\
& \leq & [S_1:S_1 \cap S_2][S_2:S_2 \cap S_3]\\
& < & \infty.
\end{eqnarray*}
Similarly, we can prove that $[S_3:S_1 \cap S_3] < \infty$ and therefore $S_1 \sim S_3$. $\square$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
\item All non-zero subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}$ are commensurable with each other.
\item All conjugacy classes of the general linear group $GL(n;\mathbb{Z})$, seen as a subgroup of $GL(n;\mathbb{Q})$, are commensurable with each other.
\end{itemize}
