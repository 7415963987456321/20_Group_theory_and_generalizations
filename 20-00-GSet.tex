\begin{document}
If $G$ is a group and $X$ a set, then $X$ is called a left $G$-Set if there exists a mapping $\lambda : G \times X \rightarrow X$ with

$$
  \lambda(g_1,\lambda(g_2,x)) = \lambda(g_1 g_2, x)
$$

or shorter with $\lambda(g,x) = gx$

$$
  g_1(g_2(x)) = (g_1 g_2)(x)
$$

for all $x \in X$ and $g_1,g_2 \in G$. And when $G$ acts on a set $X$, the set $X$ is always a $G$-set. \\ \\


$X$ is called a right $G$-Set if there exists a mapping $\lambda : X \times G \rightarrow X$ with

$$
  \lambda(\lambda(x,g_2),g_1) = \lambda(x,g_2 g_1)
