The following was  conjectured by A. Abdollahi, S. Akbari and H. R. Maimani
in (Non-commuting graph of a group, Journal of Algebra, 298 (2006) 468-492.)

{\bf Order Conjecture.} If  $G$ and
$H$ are two non-abelian finite groups with isomorphic non-commuting graphs, then $|G|=|H|$.

It was proved that  Order Conjecture is true if and only if it is true for all non-abelian solvable finite $AC$-groups.
By an $AC$-group, we mean a group in which the centralizer of every non-central element is abelian. 

The order Conjecture has been refuted in the following paper

[*] A. R. Moghaddamfar, On non-commutating graphs,  Siberian Math. J.  {\bf 47}  (2006),  no. 5, 911-914.

It is mentioned in [*] that the example given in the article is due to M. Isaacs.
