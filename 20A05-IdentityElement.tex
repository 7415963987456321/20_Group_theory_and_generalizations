Let $G$ be a groupoid, that is a set with a binary operation $G \times G \to G$, written muliplicatively so that $(x, y) \mapsto xy$.

An \emph{identity element} for $G$ is an element $e$ such that $ge = eg = g$ for all $g \in G$.

The symbol $e$ is most commonly used for identity elements.  Another  common symbol for an identity element is $1$, particularly in semigroup theory (and ring theory, considering the multiplicative structure as a semigroup).

Groups, monoids, and loops are classes of groupoids that, by definition, always have an identity element.
