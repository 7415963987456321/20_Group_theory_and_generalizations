\begin{document}
A \emph{quasigroup} is a groupoid $G$ with the property that for every $x, y \in G$, there are unique elements $w, z \in G$ such that $xw = y$ and $zx = y$.

A \emph{loop} is a \emph{quasigroup} which has an identity element.

What distinguishes a loop from a group is that the former need not satisfy the associative law.
