Let $G$ be a group.

A \emph{descending series} of $G$
is a family $(H_\alpha)_{\alpha\le\beta}$ of subgroups of $G$,
where $\beta$ is an ordinal,
such that $H_0=G$ and $H_\beta=\{1\}$,
and $H_{\alpha+1}\normal H_\alpha$ for all $\alpha<\beta$,
and $$\bigcap_{\alpha<\delta}H_\alpha=H_\delta$$
whenever $\delta\le\beta$ is a limit ordinal.

Note that this is a generalization of the concept of a subnormal series.
Compare also the dual concept of an ascending series.

Given a descending series $(H_\alpha)_{\alpha\le\beta}$,
the subgroups $H_\alpha$ are called the \emph{terms} of the series
and the \PMlinkname{quotients}{QuotientGroup} $H_\alpha/H_{\alpha+1}$
are called the \emph{factors} of the series.

A subgroup of $G$ that is a term of some descending series of $G$
is called a \emph{descendant subgroup} of $G$.

A descending series of $G$
in which all terms are normal in $G$
is called a \emph{descending normal series}.

Let $\mathfrak{X}$ be a property of groups.
A group is said to be \emph{hypo-$\mathfrak{X}$}
if it has a descending normal series
whose factors all have property $\mathfrak{X}$.
So, for example, a \emph{hypoabelian group}
is a group that has a descending normal series with abelian factors.
Hypoabelian groups are sometimes called \emph{SD-groups};
they are precisely the groups that have no non-trivial perfect subgroups,
and they are also precisely the groups
in which the transfinite derived series eventually reaches $\{1\}$.
