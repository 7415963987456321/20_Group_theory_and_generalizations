\begin{document}
A \emph{left zero semigroup} is a semigroup in which every element is a left zero element.  In other words, it is a set $S$ with a product defined as $xy = x$ for all $x, y \in S$.

A \emph{right zero semigroup} is defined similarly.

Let $S$ be a semigroup.  Then $S$ is a \emph{null semigroup} if it has a zero element and if the product of any two elements is zero.  In other words, there is an element $\theta \in S$ such that $xy = \theta$ for all $x, y \in S$.
