\begin{thm} Every doubly transitive group is \PMlinkname{primitive}{PrimativeTransitivePermutationGroupOnASet}.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Let $G$ acting on $X$ be doubly transitive. To show the action is \PMlinkescapetext{primitive}, we must show that all blocks are trivial blocks; to do this, it suffices to show that any block containing more than one element is all of $X$. So choose a block $Y$ with two distinct elements $y_1, y_2$. Given an arbitrary $x\in X$, since $G$ is doubly transitive, we can choose $\sigma\in G$ such that
\[\sigma\cdot(y_1,y_2)=(y_1,x)\]
But then $\sigma\cdot Y\cap Y\neq\emptyset$, since $y_1$ is in both. Thus $\sigma\cdot Y=Y$, so $x\in Y$ as well. So $Y=X$ and we are done.
\end{proof}
