Let $S$ be a semigroup.  If $S$ has no ideals other than itself, then $S$ is said to be \emph{simple}.

If $S$ has no left ideals [resp. right ideals] other than itself, then $S$ is said to be \emph{left simple} [resp. \emph{right simple}].

Right simple and left simple are stronger conditions than simple.

A semigroup $S$ is left simple if and only if $Sa = S$ for all $a \in S$.
A semigroup is both left and right simple if and only if it is a group.

If $S$ has a zero element $\theta$, then $0 = \{ \theta \}$ is always an ideal of $S$, so $S$ is not simple (unless it has only one element).  So in studying semigroups with a zero, a slightly weaker definition is required.

Let $S$ be a semigroup with a zero.  Then $S$ is \emph{zero simple}, or $0$-simple, if the following conditions hold:
\begin{itemize}
\item $S^2 \neq 0$
\item $S$ has no ideals except $0$ and $S$ itself
\end{itemize}

The condition $S^2 = 0$ really only eliminates one semigroup: the 2-element null semigroup.  Excluding this semigroup makes parts of the structure theory of semigroups cleaner.
