\begin{document}
Let $A$ be an arbitrary set,
let $A^\ast$ be the free monoid on $A$,
and let $X$ be a subset of $A^\ast.$
It follows from the characterization of free submonoids
that the intersection $M$ of all the free submonoids of $A^\ast$
that contain $X$ is a free submonoid of $A^\ast$.
The minimal generating set $H$ of $M$
is called the \emph{free hull} of $X$.
