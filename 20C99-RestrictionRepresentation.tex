\begin{document}
Let $\rho: G \longrightarrow \GL(V)$ be a representation on a group $G$. The {\em restriction representation} of $\rho$ to a subgroup $H$ of $G$, denoted $\operatorname{Res}^G_H(V)$, is the representation $\rho|_H: H \longrightarrow \GL(V)$ obtained by restricting the function $\rho$ to the subset $H \subset G$.
