Let $N$ be the cardinality of the set of all the couples $(g,x)$ such that $g \cdot x = x$. For each $g \in G$, there exist $\operatorname{stab}_g(X)$ couples with $g$ as the first element, while for each $x$, there are $|G_x|$ couples with $x$ as the second element. Hence the following equality holds:
\[ N = \sum_{g \in G} \operatorname{stab}_g(X) = \sum_{x \in X} |G_x|. \] 
From the orbit-stabilizer theorem it follows that:
\[ N = |G| \sum_{x \in X} \frac{1}{|G(x)|}. \]
Since all the $x$ belonging to the same orbit $G(x)$ contribute with
\[ |G(x)| \frac{1}{|G(x)|} = 1 \]
in the sum, then $\sum_{x\in X} 1/|G(x)|$ precisely equals the number of distinct orbits $s$. We have therefore
\[ \sum_{g \in G} \operatorname{stab}_g(X) = |G| s, \]
which proves the theorem.
