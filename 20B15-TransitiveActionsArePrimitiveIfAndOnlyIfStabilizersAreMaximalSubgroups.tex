\begin{thm} If $G$ is transitive on the set $A$, then $G$ is primitive on $A$ if and only if for each $a\in A$, $G_a$ is a maximal subgroup of $G$. Here $G_a=\Stab_G(a)$ is the stabilizer of $a\in A$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
First claim that if $G$ is transitive on $A$ and $B\subset A$ is a \PMlinkname{block}{BlockSystem} with $a\in B$, then $G_B=\{\sigma\in G\ \mid\ \sigma(B)=B\}$ is a subgroup of $G$ containing $G_a$. It is obvious that $G_B$ is a subgroup, since
\begin{gather*}
\sigma\in G_B\Rightarrow \sigma(B)=B\Rightarrow \sigma^{-1}(\sigma(B))=\sigma^{-1}(B)\Rightarrow B=\sigma^{-1}(B)\Rightarrow \sigma^{-1}\in G_B\\
\sigma,\tau\in G_B \Rightarrow (\sigma\tau)(B)=\sigma(\tau(B))=\sigma(B)=B\Rightarrow \sigma\tau\in G_B
\end{gather*}
But also, if $\sigma\in G_a$ for $a\in B$, then $\sigma(a)=a$, so $\sigma(B)\cap B\neq \emptyset$ and thus $\sigma(B)=B$ since $B$ is a block system and thus $\sigma\in G_B$. This proves the claim.

To prove the theorem, note that for each $a\in A$, there is by the claim a $1-1$ correspondence between \PMlinkescapetext{blocks} containing $a$ and subgroups of $G$ containing $G_a$. Thus, $G$ is primitive on $A$ if and only if all blocks are either of size $1$ or equal to $A$, if and only if any group containing $G_a$ is either $G_a$ itself or $G$, if and only if for all $a\in A$, $G_a$ is maximal in $G$.
\end{proof}
