Let $G$ be a group.

A subset $X\subseteq G$ is said to \emph{generate} $G$ 
(or to be a \emph{generating set} of $G$) 
if no proper subgroup of $G$ contains $X$.

A subset $X\subseteq G$ generates $G$ if and only if
every element of $G$ can be expressed as 
a product of elements of $X$ and inverses of elements of $X$ 
(taking the empty product to be the identity element).
A subset $X\subseteq G$ is said to be \emph{closed under inverses}
if $x^{-1}\in X$ whenever $x\in X$; 
if a generating set $X$ of $G$ is closed under inverses, 
then every element of $G$ is a product of elements of $X$.

A group that has a generating set with only one element 
is called a cyclic group.
A group that has a generating set with only finitely many elements 
is called a finitely generated group.

If $X$ is an arbitrary subset of $G$,
then the subgroup of $G$ \emph{generated by} $X$, denoted by $\genby{X}$,
is the smallest subgroup of $G$ that contains $X$.

The \emph{generating rank} of $G$ is 
the minimum cardinality of a generating set of $G$. 
(This is sometimes just called the \emph{rank} of $G$, but this can 
cause confusion with other meanings of the term {\it rank}.)
If $G$ is uncountable, then its generating rank is simply $|G|$.
