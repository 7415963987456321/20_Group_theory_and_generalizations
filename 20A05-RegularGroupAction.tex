\begin{document}
Let $G$ be a group action on a set $X$.
The action is called \PMlinkescapetext{\emph{regular}} if for any pair $\alpha, \beta \in X$ there
exists exactly one $g \in G$ such that $g \cdot \alpha = \beta$. (For a
right
group action it is defined correspondingly.)

A key example of a regular action is the regular representation of a group, with action given by group multiplication.
