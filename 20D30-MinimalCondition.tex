\begin{document}
A group is said to satisfy the \emph{minimal condition} if every strictly descending chain of subgroups
$$G_1 \supset G_2 \supset G_3 \supset \cdots$$
is finite.

This is also called the \emph{descending chain condition}.

A group which satisfies the minimal condition is necessarily periodic.  For if it contained an element $x$ of infinite order, then $$\langle x \rangle \supset \langle x^2 \rangle \supset \langle x^4 \rangle \supset \cdots \supset \langle x^{2^n} \rangle \supset \cdots$$ is an infinite descending chain of subgroups.

Similar properties are useful in other classes of algebraic structures: see for example the Artinian condition for rings and modules.
