A group $G$ is \emph{virtually abelian} (or \emph{abelian-by-finite})
if it has an abelian \PMlinkname{subgroup}{Subgroup} of finite \PMlinkname{index}{Coset}.

More generally, let $\chi$ be a property of groups.
A group $G$ is \emph{virtually $\chi$} if it has a subgroup of finite index with the property $\chi$.
A group $G$ is \emph{$\chi$-by-finite} if it has a normal subgroup of finite index with the property $\chi$.
Note that every $\chi$-by-finite group is virtually $\chi$,
and the converse also holds if the property $\chi$ is inherited by subgroups.

These notions are obviously only of relevance to infinite groups, as all finite groups are virtually trivial (and trivial-by-finite).
