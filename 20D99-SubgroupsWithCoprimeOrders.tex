\begin{document}
If the orders of two subgroups of a group are \PMlinkname{coprime}{Coprime}, the identity element is the only common element of the subgroups.\\

\emph{Proof.}\, Let $G$ and $H$ be such subgroups and $|G|$ and $|H|$ their orders.\, Then the intersection $G\!\cap\!H$ is a subgroup of both $G$ and $H$.\, By Lagrange's theorem, $|G\!\cap\!H|$ divides both $|G|$ and $|H|$ and consequently it divides also\, $\gcd(|G|,\,|H|)$\, which is 1.\, Therefore\, $|G\!\cap\!H| = 1$,\, whence the intersection contains only the identity element.\\

\textbf{Example.}\, All subgroups 
$$\{(1),\,(12)\},\quad \{(1),\,(13)\}, \quad \{(1),\,(23)\}$$
of order 2 of the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_3$ have only the identity element $(1)$ common with the sole subgroup
$$\{(1),\,(123),\,(132)\}$$
of order 3.
