\begin{document}
The derived subgroup $[G,G]$ is a fully invariant subgroup because if $f$ is an endomorphism of $G$, then for each word of commutators $[a_1,b_1][a_2,b_2]\cdots[a_m,b_m]$, we have 
$$f([a_1,b_1][a_2,b_2]\cdots[a_m,b_m])=[fa_1,fb_1][fa_2,fb_2]\cdots[fa_m,fb_m]\in [G,G]$$
i.e. the homomorphic image of a word of commutators is a word of commutators.
