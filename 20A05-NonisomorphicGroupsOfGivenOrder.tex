\textbf{Theorem.}\, For every positive integer $n$, there exists only a finite amount of non-isomorphic groups of order $n$.\\

This assertion follows from Cayley's theorem, according to which any group of order $n$ is isomorphic with a subgroup of the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$.\, The number of non-isomorphic subgroups of $\mathfrak{S}_n$ cannot be greater than
$${n!\!-\!1 \choose n\!-\!1}.$$\\

The above theorem may be used in proving the following Landau's theorem:

\textbf{Theorem (Landau).}\, For every positive integer $n$, there exists only a finite amount of finite non-isomorphic groups which contain exactly $n$ conjugacy classes of elements.\\

One needs also the

\textbf{Lemma.}\, If\, $n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$\, and\, $0 < r \in \mathbb{R}$,\, then there is at most a finite amount of the vectors \,$(m_1,\,m_2,\,\ldots,\,m_n)$\, consisting of positive integers such that
$$\sum_{j=1}^n\frac{1}{m_j} \;=\; r.$$
The lemma is easily proved by induction on $n$.
