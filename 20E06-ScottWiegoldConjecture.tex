The Scott-Wiegold conjecture (1976) is stated as follows: 

Given distinct prime numbers $p$, $q$ and $r$, the free product of cyclic groups $C_p * C_q * C_r$ is not the normal closure of any single element.

In 1992 this was included as problem 5.53 of The Kourovka Notebook: {\it Unsolved Problems in \PMlinkescapetext{Group Theory}} \cite{Kour}.

The conjecture was proven to be true in 2001 by James Howie \cite{Howi}.  Despite remaining an unsolved problem for 25 years, the proof is both brief and fairly elementary.

Whilst the question is group theoretic and involves only \PMlinkescapetext{discrete objects}, the proof does not use any combinatorial \PMlinkescapetext{arguments} but instead depends on basic notions from topology.
