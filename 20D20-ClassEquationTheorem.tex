\begin{document}
Let $G$ be a group acting on a finite set $X$. Define the set of invariants in $X$ by the action of $G$ as $G_{X}=\{x \in X  \quad \lvert \quad gx=x \quad \forall g \in G\}$. Then there are $H_{1}, ..., H_{r}$ subgroups of $G$ with $H_{i} \neq G \quad \forall i$ such that
$\#X = \#G_{X} + \sum_{i=1}^{r}[G:H_{i}]$
