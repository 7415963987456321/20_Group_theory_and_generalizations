\begin{document}
The {\em order} of a group $G$ is the number of elements of $G$, denoted $|G|$; if $|G|$ is finite, then $G$ is said to be a {\em finite group}. 

The {\em order} of an element $g \in G$ is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $g^n=e$, where $e$ is the identity element; if there is no such $n$, then $g$ is said to be of {\em infinite order}.  By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in a finite group divides the order of the group.
