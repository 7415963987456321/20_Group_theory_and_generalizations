\begin{document}
Let $G$ be a group. Then $G$ has a $BN$-pair or a Tits system if the following conditions hold:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
$B$ and $N$ are subgroups of $G$ such that $G=<B,N>$.
\item
$B\cap N =T \triangleleft N$ and $N/T=W$ is a group generated by a set $S$.
\item
$sBw \subseteq BwB \cup BswB$ for all $s\in S$ and $w\in W$.
\item
$sBs^{-1} \not\subseteq B$ for all $s\in S$.
\end{enumerate}

Where $BwB$ is a double coset with respect to $B$. It can be proven that $S$ is in fact made up of elements of order 2, and that $W$ is a Coxeter group. 

{\bf Example:} Let $G=GL_n(\mathbb{K})$ where $\mathbb{K}$ is some field. Then, if we let $B$ be the subgroup of upper triangular matrices and $N$ be the subgroup of monomial matrices (i.e. matrices having one nonzero entry in each row and each column, or more precisely the stabilizer of the lines $\{[e_1],...,[e_n]\}$). Then, it can be shown that $B$ and $N$ generate $G$ and that $T$ is the subgroup of diagonal matrices. In turn, it follows that $W$ in this case is isomorphic to the symmetric group on $n$ letters, $S_n$.
