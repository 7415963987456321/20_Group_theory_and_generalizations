A \emph{medial quasigroup} is a quasigroup such that, for any choice of four elements $a,b,c,d$, one has
 \[ (a \cdot b) \cdot (c \cdot d) = (a \cdot c) \cdot (b\cdot d) .\]

Any commutative quasigroup is trivially a medial quasigroup.  A nontrivial class of examples may be constructed as follows.  Take a commutative group $(G,+)$ and two automorphisms $f, g \colon G \to G$ which commute with each other, and an element $c$ of $G$.  Then, if we define an operation $\cdot \colon G \times G \to G$ as 
 \[ x \cdot y = f(a) + g(b) + c ,\]
$(G,\cdot)$ is a medial quasigroup.
