We assume that all representations ($G$-modules) are finite-dimensional.

\begin{defn} If $N_1$ and $N_2$ are $G$-modules over a field $k$ (i.e. representations of $G$ in $N_1$ and $N_2$), then a map $\varphi:N_1\to N_2$ is a \emph{$G$-map} if $\varphi$ is $k$-linear and preserves the $G$-action, i.e. if 
\[\varphi(\sigma \cdot x)=\sigma\cdot \varphi(x)\] 
\end{defn}

$G$-maps have subrepresentations, also called $G$-submodules, as their kernel and image. To see this, let $\varphi:N_1\to N_2$ be a $G$-map; let $M_1\subset N_1$ and $M_2\subset N_2$ be the kernel and image respectively of $\varphi$. $M_1$ is a submodule of $N_1$ if it is stable under the action of $G$, but
\[x\in M_1\Rightarrow \varphi(\sigma\cdot x)=\sigma\cdot\varphi(x)=0\Rightarrow \sigma\cdot x\in M_1\]
$M_2$ is a submodule of $N_2$ if it is stable under the action of $G$, but
\[y=\varphi(x)\in M_2\Rightarrow \sigma\cdot y=\sigma\cdot \varphi(x)=\varphi(\sigma\cdot x)\Rightarrow \sigma\cdot y\in M_2\]

Finally, we define the intuitive concept of a quotient $G$-module. Suppose $N'\subset N$ is a $G$-submodule. Then $N/N'$ is a finite-dimensional vector space. We can define an action of $G$ on $N/N'$ via $\sigma(n+N')=\sigma(n)+\sigma(N')=\sigma(n)+N'$, so that $n+N'$ is well-defined under the action and $N/N'$ is a $G$-module.
