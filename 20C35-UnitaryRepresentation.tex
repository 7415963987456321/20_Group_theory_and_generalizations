\begin{document}
Let $G$ be a topological group. A \emph{unitary representation} of $G$
is a pair $(\pi, H)$ where $H$ is a Hilbert space and 
$\pi: G \to U(H)$ is a homomorphism such that
the mapping of $G \times H \to H$ that sends $(g,v)$ to $\pi(g)v$
is continuous. Here $U(H)$ denotes the set of unitary operators
of $H$.
The group $G$ is said to act unitarily on $H$ or sometimes, 
$G$ is said to act by unitary representation on $H$.
