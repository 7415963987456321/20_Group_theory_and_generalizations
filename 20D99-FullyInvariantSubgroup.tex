\begin{document}
A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is \emph{fully invariant} if  $f(H) \subseteq H$
for all endomorphisms $f \colon G \to G$.  Such a subgroup is also called \emph{fully characteristic}.

This is a stronger condition than being a characteristic subgroup.

The derived subgroup is fully invariant.
