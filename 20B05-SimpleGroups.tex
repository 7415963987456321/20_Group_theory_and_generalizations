\begin{document}
Recall that a group $G$ is simple if it has no normal
subgroups except itself and $\{e\}$.  Let $G$ be a finite
simple group and let $p$ be a prime number. \\[.05in]

(a) Suppose $G$ has precisely $k$ Sylow $p$-subgroups with
$k >1$. Show that $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of the
symmetric group $S_k$. \\[.05in]

(b) With the same hypothesis, show that $G$ is isomorphic
to a subgroup of the alternating group $A_k$. \\[.05in]

(c) Suppose $G$ is a simple group that is a proper
subgroup of $A_k$ and $k \geq 5$. Show that the index
$[A_k : G] \geq k$. \\[.05in]

(d) Prove that if $G$ is a group of order $120$ then $G$
is not a simple group. (Parts (b) and (c) may be helpful.)
