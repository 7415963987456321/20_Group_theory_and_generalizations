It is easy to understand that ${\rm Out}\mathbb{Z}={\rm Aut}\mathbb{Z}=\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, since $\mathbb{Z}$ is abelian and there are no inner-automorphisms, save the trivial one.

Also, it is known that ${\rm Out} SL(2,\mathbb{Z})=\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$

Another example is that, at least for orientable surfaces, the extended mapping class group (or the zeroth homeotopy group) of a surface $F$ is related to its fundamental group via ${\cal{M}^*}(F)={\rm Out}(\pi_1(F))$.
